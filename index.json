Its many applications include image reconstruction, data analysis, and the numerical solution of differential equations. We present FINUFFT, an efficient parallel library for type 1 (nonuiform to uniform), type 2 (uniform to nonuniform), or type 3 (nonuniform to nonuniform) transforms, in dimensions 1, 2, or 3. It uses minimal RAM, requires no precomputation or plan steps, and has a simple interface to several languages. We perform the expensive spreading/interpolation between nonuniform points and the fine grid via a simple new kernel---the `exponential of semicircle' $e^{β \\sqrt{1-x^2}}$ in $x \\in [-1,1]$---in a cache-aware load-balanced multithreaded implementation. The deconvolution step requires the Fourier transform of the kernel, for which we propose efficient numerical quadrature. For types 1 and 2, rigorous error bounds asymptotic in the kernel width approach the fastest known exponential rate, namely that of the Kaiser--Bessel kernel. We benchmark against several popular CPU-based libraries, showing favorable speed and memory footprint, especially in three dimensions when high accuracy and/or clustered point distributions are desired.","tags":null,"title":"A parallel non-uniform fast Fourier transform library based on an \"exponential of semicircle\" kernel","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ludvig af Klinteberg","Anna-Karin Tornberg"],"categories":null,"content":"Copyright of final published version belongs Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.\n","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"cfd2003d7c7f009c40f5302e34e436c0","permalink":"https://ludvigak.github.io/publication/2018-aqbx/","publishdate":"2019-05-31T19:23:26.882143Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-aqbx/","section":"publication","summary":"Copyright of final published version belongs Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.","tags":null,"title":"Adaptive Quadrature by Expansion for Layer Potential Evaluation in Two Dimensions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ludvig af Klinteberg","Davoud Saffar Shamshirgar","Anna-Karin Tornberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"c50ef7117d09fc00df63307ed419c252","permalink":"https://ludvigak.github.io/publication/2016-fse/","publishdate":"2019-05-31T19:23:26.878984Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016-fse/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a spectrally accurate method for the rapid evaluation of free-space Stokes potentials, i.e. sums involving a large number of free space Green's functions. We consider sums involving stokeslets, stresslets and rotlets that appear in boundary integral methods and potential methods for solving Stokes equations. The method combines the framework of the Spectral Ewald method for periodic problems, with a very recent approach to solving the free-space harmonic and biharmonic equations using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) on a uniform grid. Convolution with a truncated Gaussian function is used to place point sources on a grid. With precomputation of a scalar grid quantity that does not depend on these sources, the amount of oversampling of the grids with Gaussians can be kept at a factor of two, the minimum for aperiodic convolutions by FFTs. The resulting algorithm has a computational complexity of O(N log N) for problems with N sources and targets. Comparison is made with a fast multipole method (FMM) to show that the performance of the new method is competitive.","tags":null,"title":"Fast Ewald summation for free-space Stokes potentials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ludvig af Klinteberg","Anna-Karin Tornberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1485907200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485907200,"objectID":"14b7db8df98b2d7028b3a865ac694ff9","permalink":"https://ludvigak.github.io/publication/2017-quad/","publishdate":"2019-05-31T19:23:26.880067Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-quad/","section":"publication","summary":"In boundary integral methods it is often necessary to evaluate layer potentials on or close to the boundary, where the underlying integral is difficult to evaluate numerically. Quadrature by expansion (QBX) is a new method for dealing with such integrals, and it is based on forming a local expansion of the layer potential close to the boundary. In doing so, one introduces a new quadrature error due to nearly singular integration in the evaluation of expansion coefficients. Using a method based on contour integration and calculus of residues, the quadrature error of nearly singular integrals can be accurately estimated. This makes it possible to derive accurate estimates for the quadrature errors related to QBX, when applied to layer potentials in two and three dimensions. As examples we derive estimates for the Laplace and Helmholtz single layer potentials. These results can be used for parameter selection in practical applications.","tags":null,"title":"Error estimation for quadrature by expansion in layer potential evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ludvig af Klinteberg","Anna-Karin Tornberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1480550400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480550400,"objectID":"af5f5983e603f727b8fd44c3d4c657b7","permalink":"https://ludvigak.github.io/publication/2016-qbx/","publishdate":"2019-05-31T19:23:26.880973Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016-qbx/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A fast integral equation method for solid particles in viscous flow using quadrature by expansion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ludvig af Klinteberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1456790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1456790400,"objectID":"fcd699cab84f3bd8e784d969cefc8769","permalink":"https://ludvigak.github.io/publication/2016-rot/","publishdate":"2019-05-31T19:23:26.879553Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016-rot/","section":"publication","summary":"Ewald summation is an efficient method for computing the periodic sums that appear when considering the Green's functions of Stokes flow together with periodic boundary conditions.

We present a numerical method for two-phase flow with insoluble surfactants and contact line dynamics in two dimensions. The method is based on decomposing the interface between two fluids into segments, which are explicitly represented on a local Eulerian grid. It provides a natural framework for treating the surfactant concentration equation, which is solved locally on each segment. An accurate numerical method for the coupled interface/surfactant system is given. The system is coupled to the Navier-Stokes equations through the immersed boundary method, and we discuss the issue of force regularization in wetting problems, when the interface touches the boundary of the domain. We use the method to illustrate how the presence of surfactants influences the behavior of free and wetting drops. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","tags":["Immersed boundary method","Insoluble surfactant","Marangoni force","Moving contact line","Multiphase flow"],"title":"An explicit Eulerian method for multiphase flow with contact line dynamics and insoluble surfactant","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ludvig af Klinteberg","Anna-Karin Tornberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"3c7553907c17f6da3e2d31f046d74c38","permalink":"https://ludvigak.github.io/publication/2014-ewald/","publishdate":"2019-05-31T19:23:26.881348Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014-ewald/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Fast Ewald summation for Stokesian particle suspensions","type":"publication"}]
