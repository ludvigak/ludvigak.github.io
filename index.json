Since it exploits complex analysis, its use has been restricted to two dimensions (2D). We first explain its loss of accuracy as panels become curved, using a classical complex approximation result of Walsh that can be interpreted as ‚Äúelectrostatic shielding‚Äù of a Schwarz singularity. We then introduce a variant that swaps the target singularity for one at its complexified parameter preimage; in the latter space the panel is flat, hence the convergence rate can be much higher. The preimage is found robustly by Newton iteration. This idea also enables, for the first time, a near-singular quadrature for potentials generated by smooth curves in 3D, building on recurrences of Tornberg‚ÄìGustavsson. We apply this to accurate evaluation of the Stokes flow near to a curved filament in the slender body approximation. Our 3D method is several times more efficient (both in terms of kernel evaluations, and in speed in a C implementation) than the only existing alternative, namely, adaptive integration.","tags":null,"title":"Accurate quadrature of nearly singular line integrals in two and three dimensions by singularity swapping","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ludvig af Klinteberg","Travis Askham","Mary Catherine Kropinski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582588800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582588800,"objectID":"469d1a7151d02d49f53d8bcf00e8aef1","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/2020-nse2d/","publishdate":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-nse2d/","section":"publication","summary":"The integral equation approach to partial differential equations (PDEs) provides significant advantages in the numerical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, the divergence-free condition and boundary conditions are handled naturally, and the ill-conditioning caused by high order terms in the PDE is preconditioned analytically. Despite these advantages, the adoption of integral equation methods has been slow due to a number of difficulties in their implementation. This work describes a complete integral equation-based flow solver that builds on recently developed methods for singular quadrature and the solution of PDEs on complex domains, in combination with several more well-established numerical methods. We apply this solver to flow problems on a number of geometries, both simple and challenging, studying its convergence properties and computational performance. This serves as a demonstration that it is now relatively straightforward to develop a robust, efficient, and flexible Navier-Stokes solver, using integral equation methods.","tags":null,"title":"A Fast Integral Equation Method for the Two-Dimensional Navier-Stokes Equations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex H.

It uses minimal RAM, requires no precomputation or plan steps, and has a simple interface to several languages. We perform the expensive spreading/interpolation between nonuniform points and the fine grid via a simple new kernel---the `exponential of semicircle' $e^{Œ≤ \\sqrt{1-x^2}}$ in $x \\in [-1,1]$---in a cache-aware load-balanced multithreaded implementation. The deconvolution step requires the Fourier transform of the kernel, for which we propose efficient numerical quadrature. For types 1 and 2, rigorous error bounds asymptotic in the kernel width approach the fastest known exponential rate, namely that of the Kaiser--Bessel kernel. We benchmark against several popular CPU-based libraries, showing favorable speed and memory footprint, especially in three dimensions when high accuracy and/or clustered point distributions are desired.","tags":null,"title":"A parallel non-uniform fast Fourier transform library based on an \"exponential of semicircle\" kernel","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ludvig af Klinteberg","Fredrik Fryklund","Anna-Karin Tornberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566259200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566259200,"objectID":"95233f8e019004dbe947f44af4b2025d","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/2019-largealphaquad/","publishdate":"2019-08-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-largealphaquad/","section":"publication","summary":"Panel-based, kernel-split quadrature is currently one of the most efficient methods available for accurate evaluation of singular and nearly singular layer potentials in two dimensions. However, it can fail completely for the layer potentials belonging to the modified Helmholtz, biharmonic and Stokes equations. These equations depend on a parameter, denoted $\u0007lpha$, and kernel-split quadrature loses its accuracy rapidly when this parameter grows beyond a certain threshold. The present report describes an algorithm that remedies this problem, using per-target adaptive sampling of the source geometry. The refinement is carried out through recursive bisection, with a carefully selected rule set. This maintains accuracy for a wide range of $\\alpha$, at an increased cost that scales as $\\log\\alpha$. Using this algorithm allows kernel-split quadrature to be both accurate and efficient for a much wider range of problems than previously possible.","tags":null,"title":"An adaptive kernel-split quadrature method for parameter-dependent layer potentials","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

We consider sums involving stokeslets, stresslets and rotlets that appear in boundary integral methods and potential methods for solving Stokes equations. The method combines the framework of the Spectral Ewald method for periodic problems, with a very recent approach to solving the free-space harmonic and biharmonic equations using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) on a uniform grid. Convolution with a truncated Gaussian function is used to place point sources on a grid. With precomputation of a scalar grid quantity that does not depend on these sources, the amount of oversampling of the grids with Gaussians can be kept at a factor of two, the minimum for aperiodic convolutions by FFTs. The resulting algorithm has a computational complexity of O(N log N) for problems with N sources and targets. Comparison is made with a fast multipole method (FMM) to show that the performance of the new method is competitive.","tags":null,"title":"Fast Ewald summation for free-space Stokes potentials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ludvig af Klinteberg","Anna-Karin Tornberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1485907200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485907200,"objectID":"14b7db8df98b2d7028b3a865ac694ff9","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/2017-quad/","publishdate":"2019-05-31T19:23:26.880067Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-quad/","section":"publication","summary":"In boundary integral methods it is often necessary to evaluate layer potentials on or close to the boundary, where the underlying integral is difficult to evaluate numerically. Quadrature by expansion (QBX) is a new method for dealing with such integrals, and it is based on forming a local expansion of the layer potential close to the boundary. In doing so, one introduces a new quadrature error due to nearly singular integration in the evaluation of expansion coefficients. Using a method based on contour integration and calculus of residues, the quadrature error of nearly singular integrals can be accurately estimated. This makes it possible to derive accurate estimates for the quadrature errors related to QBX, when applied to layer potentials in two and three dimensions. As examples we derive estimates for the Laplace and Helmholtz single layer potentials. These results can be used for parameter selection in practical applications.","tags":null,"title":"Error estimation for quadrature by expansion in layer potential evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ludvig af Klinteberg","Anna-Karin Tornberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1480550400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480550400,"objectID":"af5f5983e603f727b8fd44c3d4c657b7","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/2016-qbx/","publishdate":"2019-05-31T19:23:26.880973Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016-qbx/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A fast integral equation method for solid particles in viscous flow using quadrature by expansion","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

We present a numerical method for two-phase flow with insoluble surfactants and contact line dynamics in two dimensions. The method is based on decomposing the interface between two fluids into segments, which are explicitly represented on a local Eulerian grid. It provides a natural framework for treating the surfactant concentration equation, which is solved locally on each segment. An accurate numerical method for the coupled interface/surfactant system is given. The system is coupled to the Navier-Stokes equations through the immersed boundary method, and we discuss the issue of force regularization in wetting problems, when the interface touches the boundary of the domain. We use the method to illustrate how the presence of surfactants influences the behavior of free and wetting drops. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","tags":["Immersed boundary method","Insoluble surfactant","Marangoni force","Moving contact line","Multiphase flow"],"title":"An explicit Eulerian method for multiphase flow with contact line dynamics and insoluble surfactant","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ludvig af Klinteberg","Anna-Karin Tornberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"3c7553907c17f6da3e2d31f046d74c38","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/2014-ewald/","publishdate":"2019-05-31T19:23:26.881348Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2014-ewald/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Fast Ewald summation for Stokesian particle suspensions","type":"publication"}]
